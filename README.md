Project Summary:
I collaborated with Airgead Banking to create a C++ application that demonstrates the concept of compound interest to high school students. The application allows users to input variables like initial investment, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and investment period, and shows how their investments will grow.

Strengths of My Approach:
I effectively designed a user-friendly interface that prompts users for input and displays results clearly. My implementation of loops and conditional statements accurately handled the compound interest calculations, enhancing user comprehension.

Areas for Improvement:
Potential improvements include:
To enhance efficiency, creating a dedicated function for interest calculations could streamline the code. Adding input validation would increase the application's robustness and security.

Challenges Encountered:
The most challenging aspect was ensuring accurate interest calculations in different scenarios. I addressed this by conducting detailed testing and consulting resources such as Stack Overflow and C++ documentation to refine my understanding of C++ operations.

Tools and Resources Added:
I've enriched my resource toolkit with C++ reference sites and coding forums and plan to use Microsoft Visual Studio for better code management in future projects.

Transferable Skills:
This project enhanced my problem-solving skills, knowledge of software design principles, and mastery of programming fundamentals like loops and conditionals, which are broadly applicable across various programming contexts.

Code Maintenance, Readability, and Adaptability:
I ensured the program was maintainable and readable by using clear naming conventions and inline comments. This approach aids in understanding the code and facilitates its adaptability for different financial scenarios.
